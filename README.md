## so the v1 is not finished bcoz i need to compile and also the V2 V3 V4 will be planned*

To build from source, it's pretty simple:
- Install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) (make sure to use the latest version!!)
- Install [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/)
- Run `config.bat` to get every requirement installed
- Execute `lime test windows` or `lime build windows` to build the engine.
